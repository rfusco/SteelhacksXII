  ## Inspiration
We were inspired to create a protective software for the people who can't stand up for themselves.

## What It Does
**ElderGuardian** scans conversations and identifies unwanted or aggressive behaviors. It can be used as an indicator of abuse.

## How We Built It
ElderGuardian was built using **MongoDB**, **Flask**, and **React**.

## Challenges We Ran Into
The speaker diarization was very tricky to implement, as well as the language classifier and the dashboard.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Our database is fully connected to our frontend.

## What We Learned
We learned a lot about networking and databases, as well as planning out workflows.

## What's Next for ElderGuardian
The next step will be to implement continuous voice monitoring with a standalone device for improved surveillance and quality.
